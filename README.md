OK LET'S GET INTO IT👀🥳👾
An elevator pitch of your game idea⛺️💪🏻
- I'm thinking of creating a catch game!
- The user will be tasked with catching good items while avoiding bad items
- Can do this with foods in the supermarket possibly (try to catch yummy junk food items avoid veggies🥦)
- Can also do this with clothing items and shopping bags🛍👗👠
- Points + or - depending on the item the player comes into contact with 

What tech stack you plan on using (example: using Tailwind for styling)
- HTML
- JS
- CSS
- very possibly Canvas 


Wireframes of your game

Drew this while thinking about food, but leaning toward the player catching clothing items.

MVP Goals
- player 
- obstacles that subtract points from the score
- losing message when points go below zero 
- items for the player to catch to increase their score
- start over button 


Stretch Goals
* Moving background
* Extremely stylized game
* High score list- input your name 


Any potential roadblock
* My lack of technical knowledge 
* Goals that are out of my league 
* Self doubt
* I have struggled with fully understanding DOM elements but my goal this weekend is heavilly reviewing
